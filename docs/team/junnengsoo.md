### Project: Pawfection

Pawfection is a desktop app for managing animals in a pet shelter, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It aims to provide a platform for volunteers to
store and retrieve information about animals in a shelter easily.
